When i first told you that I love you, you said you have a bf, then it turned into "I don't think you really love me".
When you finally understood that I love you "you are like a friend". Then it became "we are family and family don't do that"
the last year I finally made you to stop saying friend again..and all those tie I talked to you like a gf.
We kinda had a fight on the day you went to cuba...and then your reason was "you are not with me. you are not real. I feel loved by your love but you are not here with me. All you do is talk"...now that's a real reason that i can agree with.

but you missed me so much when you went to cuba. you had all your old friends and family and you should be happy and have no reason to think about me.
but you still missed me. you told your mom about me, and to your friends. 

actually it was like "I am waiting my friends to talk about us. maybe they can help us to solve this".

and even when you left me I been a real cry baby. i will tell you about that on some other day.
But you came back caz you missed me.

now don't fucking tell me that you don't love me or that friendship thing.
I never been a friend to you like the rest of your friends. All I ever did was love you like my soulmate.

I'm not trying to win this fight ok?
I don't care about winning an argument.
I'm trying to make you realize things and the fact that I need you in my life and I believe you need me to.
I hope you understand this
